I am a PhD student in the [Clinical Pharmaceutical Scientist](http://www.pharmacy.pitt.edu/research/clinical_pharma_science.php) track in the [Center for Clinical Pharmaceutical Sciences](https://pharmacy.pitt.edu/research/cpsc_default.php) in the [School of Pharmacy](http://www.pharmacy.pitt.edu/) at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/).

My research interest is at the intersection of clinical & quantitative pharmacology and onconephrology. Specifically, I investigate the evaluation of kidney function in cancer patients and the impact of decreased kidney function on anticancer drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Tom Nolin](http://www.pharmacy.pitt.edu/Directory/profile.php?profile=719). I am also a member of the [Small Molecule Biomarker Core](https://www.biomarkers.pitt.edu/).

I previously completed a PharmD with an Area of Concentration in Research and a B.S. in Pharmaceutical Sciences with a Minor in Chemistry at Pitt Pharmacy. I am also a faculty instructor at [Kaplan Test Prep](https://www.kaptest.com/) in the Pre-Health, Pre-Grad, and Pre-College Divisions.
